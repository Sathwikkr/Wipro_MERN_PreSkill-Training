ML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create webpages. 
It defines the structure, layout, and elements that make up a website — 
such as text, images, links, videos, and forms.
Let’s break the term down:
	• HyperText: Refers to text that contains links (called hyperlinks) to other web pages. These links connect different pages and make website navigation possible.
Example: <a href="about.html">About Us</a> connects one page to another.
	• Markup Language: Means using tags to “mark up” content so that browsers 
    know how to display it.
Example: <h1> for headings, <p> for paragraphs, <img> for images.
Together, HTML tells the browser what to display, while CSS tells it how to display it 
(style, color, layout), and JavaScript adds interactivity.
Analogy:
If a website were a human body —
	• HTML is the skeleton (structure)
	• CSS is the skin and clothing (style)
	• JavaScript is the brain and muscles (behavior)
Note: HTML is the backbone of every website — it defines what appears on the page and how the content is arranged.

Why Do We Need HTML and What Is Its Importance?
We need HTML because it is the foundation of web development. Without it, browsers would not understand how to structure or display content.
Importance of HTML
Concept	Description
Basic Building Block	HTML is the starting point for all websites. Every web page you see — from Google to YouTube — is built with HTML.
Defines Structure	It organizes content using tags like <header>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, etc.
Supports Multimedia	HTML supports embedding images, videos, audio, and interactive elements (like <video>, <audio>, <canvas>).
Works with CSS & JavaScript	HTML handles structure, CSS handles design, and JavaScript handles interactivity — the three pillars of front-end development.
Universally Supported	Every modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) understands HTML, making it the universal web language.
SEO & Accessibility	Proper HTML structure improves SEO (search ranking) and accessibility for screen readers and users with disabilities.

Basic Structure of HTML
Copy
​<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Document Title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Page Content Goes Here -->
</body>
</html>
​!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  </body>
</html>
Breakdown:
	• <!DOCTYPE html> → Defines HTML5 document.
	• <html lang="en"> → Root element with language attribute.
	• <head> → Metadata (title, character set, viewport).
<body> → Visible content of the webpage.

Common Elements Inside <head>
	1. <title> – Page Title
	2. <meta> – Metadata for SEO & Settings
	3. <link> – Linking External Resources
	4. <style> – Internal CSS
	5. <script> – JavaScript (Optional in <head>)
	6. <base> – Base URL for Relative Links
Why is the <head> Section Important?
	• Provides SEO-friendly metadata
	• Ensures proper rendering on all devices
	• Helps browsers load external stylesheets, fonts, and icons
	• Improves performance with preload, preconnect, and caching instructions

Common HTML Text Formatting Tags:
	• <b>: Bold text
	• <i>: Italic text
	• <u>: Underlined text
	• <strong>: Strong importance
	• <em>: Emphasized text
	• <small>: Smaller text
	• <mark>: Highlighted text
	• <sub> / <sup>: Subscript / Superscript
Formatting is done using two types of tags:
1. Physical (Presentational) Tags
2. Logical (Semantic) Tags

 Physical Tags (Presentational Tags)
	• Used only for visual style
	• They don’t give any extra meaning. (non-semantic)
	• Example: <b>, <i>, <u>, <small>, <sup>, <sub>
<b> – Bold Text
	• Makes text bold (only for styling, no extra meaning).
Example:

<p>This is <b>bold</b><i><small> text</small></i>.</p>

Logical Tags (Semantic Tags)
Tags that give meaning + style to text 
(important, emphasized, highlighted, deleted, inserted, etc.).
They are useful for SEO, accessibility, and screen readers.
Example: <strong>, <em>, <mark>, <del>, <ins>
<strong> – Important Text
	• Also makes text bold, but with semantic meaning (used for important text).
	• Screen readers read it with emphasis.
